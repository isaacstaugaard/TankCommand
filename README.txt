Tank Command

1) Building/executing (should work for Windows, Mac, and Linux/Unix)
	
	a) A build.xml file is available.
	b) At the command line, type in "ant" or "ant compile" to compile all source files. Source code can be found in TankCommand/src/TC.
	Class files can be found in TankCommand/bin/TC. Upon compilation, resource files (i.e. images and sound files) will be copied into 
	a resources directory in the bin directory from the src/resources directory.
	c) At the command line (if you have X11 forwarding enabled), type in "ant run" to run the program.
 

2) To add/modify data files

	Adding/modifying source code: Any source code that is modified/added should be kept within the same directory of the rest of the source
	files.
	Adding/deleting resources: Images/audio should be kept in the "resources" subdirectory in their respective
	subdirectories.
	
3) Special information

	*When playing the game, you are not allowed to resize the window. The window where the game is played is at a fixed size.
	*When pausing, you only have ~1000 seconds before the game resumes again. However, the pause menu options are
 	still present when the game resumes in this case.

4) How to play
	
	
	Welcome to Tank Command! This is a simple side-scrolling game to see how far you can get through the game while
	killing as many enemies as you can. 
	Use your standard bullets to shoot enemies. Use your powerup/superpower/rocket
	to wipe out all enemies on the map. Enemies will drop powerups for you that will either replenish health or give 
	an extra rocket. The farther you go into the game, the harder it will be! Good luck......
